--  The GRT library is built with a lot of restrictions.
--  The purpose of these restrictions (mainly No_Run_Time) is not to link with
--  the GNAT run time library.  The user does not need to download or compile
--  it.
--
--  However, GRT works without these restrictions.  If you want to use GRT
--  in Ada, you may compile GRT without these restrictions (remove the -gnatec
--  flag).
--
--  This files is *not* names gnat.adc, in order to ease the possibility of
--  not using it.
