  /// This class represents profiling event information for an ambiguity.
  /// Ambiguities are decisions where a particular input resulted in an SLL
  /// conflict, followed by LL prediction also reaching a conflict state
  /// (indicating a true ambiguity in the grammar).
  ///
  /// <para>
  /// This event may be reported during SLL prediction in cases where the
  /// conflicting SLL configuration set provides sufficient information to
  /// determine that the SLL conflict is truly an ambiguity. For example, if none
  /// of the ATN configurations in the conflicting SLL configuration set have
  /// traversed a global follow transition (i.e.
  /// <seealso cref="ATNConfig#reachesIntoOuterContext"/> is 0 for all configurations), then
  /// the result of SLL prediction for that input is known to be equivalent to the
  /// result of LL prediction for that input.</para>

  /// <para>
  /// In some cases, the minimum represented alternative in the conflicting LL
  /// configuration set is not equal to the minimum represented alternative in the
  /// conflicting SLL configuration set. Grammars and inputs which result in this
  /// scenario are unable to use <seealso cref="PredictionMode#SLL"/>, which in turn means
  /// they cannot use the two-stage parsing strategy to improve parsing performance
