# vhdl2js

Convert VHDL to Javascript and execute elaboration stage.

vhdl2js is a runtime for VHDL code translated to javascript.
It implements the elaboration stage of VHDL, generating a instance hirarchy tree
and a connection graph for signals. The elaboration stage can be run in a 
browser and the output can be used to visualize the VHDL code and implement
various inspection tools.

# Translation of VHDL to javascript

## vhdl2xml

Subdirectory vhdl2xml contains a patched GHDL (r150,gcc-4.7.2). The --xml switch is added
to GHDL. When given, the GHDL parser's AST will be dumped as XML.

## xml2js

Subdirectory xml2js contains a perl script hdl2js.pl that converts the GHDL XML output to javascript. 
hdl2js.pl requires 

XML::LibXML, 
XML::LibXML::PrettyPrint and 
Class::ISA 

to be installed 
(perl -MCPAN -e "install XML::LibXML; install XML::LibXML::PrettyPrint; install Class::ISA;").

For javascript beautification https://github.com/einars/js-beautify can be used.

## vhdl2html

Subdirectory vhdl2html contins a perl script that convert VHDL to html and
combines it with the AST generated by the vhdl2xml -> xml2js stages.
